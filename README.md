Menu Building App for Picky Kids

1. Search Bar Component: Create a component where users can input ingredients or keywords to search for recipes.
2. Recipe Display Component: Display search results in a visually appealing manner, showing recipe names, images, and maybe a brief description.
3. API Integration: Integrate with a recipe API (such as Spoonacular or Edamam) to fetch recipe data based on user input.
4. Filtering Options: Allow users to filter search results based on dietary preferences (e.g., vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free) or meal type (e.g., breakfast, lunch, dinner).
5. Detail View Component: Implement a detail view for each recipe, displaying ingredients, cooking instructions, and any additional information.
6. Favorite Recipes: Allow users to mark recipes as favorites and save them for future reference. You can use browser local storage or a simple backend database for this feature.
7. Error Handling: Handle errors gracefully, such as displaying a message if no recipes match the search criteria or if there's an issue fetching data from the API.
8. Responsive Design: Ensure that the app looks and functions well on different screen sizes, including desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
9. Styling: Use CSS or a CSS framework like Bootstrap to style the app and make it visually appealing.
This project will give you hands-on experience with React fundamentals like component creation, state management, API integration, and conditional rendering. Plus, it's a practical application that you can use to search for and save recipes you're interested in trying out.
